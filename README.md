# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

It is based on the tutorial named `"Tutorial: Build a React.js Chat App"`. You can check content of tutorial on Scaledrone blog pages following a https://www.scaledrone.com/blog/tutorial-build-a-reactjs-chat-app/ link. A project inside this repository is chat app made as a part of front-end developer course.

## Features

* Random name and color for each chat member
* Sending and receiving messages in real time 
* Input field with limited number of entries
* Counter with number of remaining characters 
* Animated header & input field when opening an app
* Screen alert when accidentally sending empty message
* Showing tooltip when the mouse pointer rests over button element

## Additional note

You can connect to your own Scaledrone room when you register at https://www.scaledrone.com page. To successfully connect to Scaledrone you need to get your own channel ID from the Scaledrone's dashboard and then replace `{YOUR_CHANNEL_ID}` in **App.js** file with it.

Example: 

```javascript
const myChannelID = '{YOUR_CHANNEL_ID}';
```


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
